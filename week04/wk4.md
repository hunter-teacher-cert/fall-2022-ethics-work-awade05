<!-- Create a plaintext file in your week04 folder named names.txt. This file should contain lines of text where some of the lines have one or more names. 
Names can be formatted in different ways. For example "John Smith" would be a name, as would "Mrs. Chen" and "Dr. S. Howard." 
Names can be formatted in many more ways as well. 
Try to include as many different ways of representing names as you can. -->
